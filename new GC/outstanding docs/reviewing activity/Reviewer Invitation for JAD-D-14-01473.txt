The Journal of Affective Disorders has a high academic reputation. We currently have about 1300 papers 
submitted each year which means that pressure on space is very high and we are unable to accept 70-
80% of the papers we receive. We would therefore be grateful if you applied a high threshold when 
choosing to recommend that a paper be accepted

With kind regards,

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Cognitive impairment is known to occur in Bipolar Disorder (BD), even in euthymic patients, 
with largest effect sizes often seen in Verbal Learning and Memory Tasks (VLT). However, comparisons 
between BD Type-I and Type-II have produced inconsistent results partly due to low sample sizes. 
Methods: This study compared the performance of 183 BDI with 96 BDII out-patients on an adapted 
version of the Rey Verbal Learning Task. Gender, age, years of education, mood scores and age at onset 
were all used as covariates. Current medication and a variety of illness variables were also investigated 
for potential effects on VLT performance. 
Results: BDI patients were significantly impaired relative to BDII patients on all five VLT outcome 
measures after controlling for the other variables [Effect Sizes = 0.13 - 0.17]. The impairments seem to 
be unrelated to drug treatment and largely unrelated to illness variables, although age of onset affected 
performance on three outcome measures and number of episodes of mood elevation affected 
performance on one.
Limitations: This study used historical healthy controls. Analysis of potential drug effects was limited by 
insufficient participants not taking antidepressants/being drug free. Cross-sectional nature of the study 
limited the analysis of the potential effect of illness variables. 
Conclusions: This study replicates earlier findings of increased verbal learning impairment in BDI patients 
relative to BDII in a substantially larger sample. Such performance cannot be wholly explained by 
medication effects or illness variables. Thus, the cognitive impairment is likely to reflect a phenotypic 
difference between bipolar sub-types.
